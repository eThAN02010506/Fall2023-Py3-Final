# Fall 2023 Python 3 Final

*For the final, you will be completing the **ttkbootstrap** application. Currently, the application has very basic navigation and widgets on the screen. You will complete it and add your own data to it.*

##### Installation Steps:

+ Fork the repo
+ Clone the repo to your local machine

##### Rubric:

+ Your application should consume your API (either the custom one you made or the tasks one we made in class)
+ Your router for the application should meet the following specifications:
  + Have all CRUD operations accounted for (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
  + Require authentication in order to access it
  + Data should be stored in a SQLite database
  + Data table contains a foreign key to identify the user each row belongs to
+ Your UI should adopt the information it gets from the database

##### Grade Breakdown

+ 75%: Rubric Requirements Met
+ 25%: UI Design

**Special Note about your UI Design: The documentation has examples of multiple ways to implement widgets and designs, use them. The more creative the result, the better your grade.*
